no dammit finally find the solution each damn shortcut have its own properties>fonts but it doesn't still accept all fonts and sizes :`I hate windowsðŸ¤¬` thanks to this [link](https://superuser.com/questions/689863/powershell-opening-with-ridiculously-tiny-font-about-5-and-wont-change-to-new)

instead now I use
- Win + r -> powershell
- Win + r -> powershell -> ctrl + shift + enter -> admin mode

there is also `oh-my-posh` and `starship`, doesn't got the time yet
