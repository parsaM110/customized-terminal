no dammit finally find the solution each damn shortcut have its own properties>fonts but it doesn't still accept all fonts and sizes :`I hate windowsðŸ¤¬`

instead now I use
- Win + r -> powershell
- Win + r -> powershell -> ctrl + shift + enter -> admin mode

there is also `oh-my-posh` and `starship`, doesn't got the time yet
